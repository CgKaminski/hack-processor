# Nand-to-Tetris

This directory contains the Nand-to-Tetris code, specifically the HDL-1 code, used in the development of my self-made simple computer.

## Description

The Nand-to-Tetris course is an educational program that guides participants through the process of building a computer system from the ground up. 
It starts with basic logic gates built using the NAND gate and progresses to the creation of a fully functional computer, including a processor, 
memory, and an operating system.

In this directory, you will find the HDL-1 code that I initially developed while following the Nand-to-Tetris course. This code represents the 
foundation of my self-made computer and serves as a reference point for the subsequent translation into SystemVerilog.

## Contents

- **/**: Contains the logic gate implementations, such as the NAND, AND, OR, and other gates, along with any additional components required for the construction of basic logic circuits.

- **/src/logic-gates**: Includes the building blocks for more complex components, such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, and adders.

- **/src/alu-chips**: Focuses on building sequential chips, including registers and memory units.

- **/src/memory-chips**, **/src/pc-chips : Implements the CPU, control unit, and other necessary components for a basic computer architecture.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code within each project directory to understand the step-by-step construction of the computer system. The Nand-to-Tetris course materials can serve as a guide 
to further understand the concepts and techniques applied in the development process.

If you are interested in my final self-made simple computer, including the translated SystemVerilog code, you can refer to the appropriate directories outside of this "Nand-to-Tetris" directory.
