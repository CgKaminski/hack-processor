# Nand-to-Tetris

This directory contains the Nand-to-Tetris code, specifically the HDL-1 code, 
 used in the development of my self-made simple computer.

## Description

The Nand-to-Tetris course is an educational program that guides participants 
 through the process of building a computer system from the ground up. It starts
 with basic logic gates built using the NAND gate and progresses to the creation
 of a fully functional computer, including a processor, memory, and an operating
 system.

In this directory, you will find the HDL-1 code that I initially developed while
 following the Nand-to-Tetris course. This code represents the foundation of my 
 self-made computer and serves as a reference point for the subsequent 
 translation into SystemVerilog.

## Contents

- **/src/logic-gates**: Contains the logic gate implementations, such as the 
 NAND, AND, OR, and other gates, along with any additional components required
 for the construction of basic logic circuits.

- **/src/alu-chipss**: Includes the building blocks for more complex components,
 such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, and adders.

- **/src/memory-chips**: Focuses on building sequential chips, including
 registers and memory units.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code within each project directory to understand the 
 step-by-step construction of the computer system. The Nand-to-Tetris course 
 materials can serve as a guide to further understand the concepts and 
 techniques applied in the development process.

If you are interested in my final self-made simple computer, including the
 translated SystemVerilog code, you can refer to the appropriate directories 
 outside of this "Nand-to-Tetris" directory.
